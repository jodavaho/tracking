# tracking
Unfortunately, my full tracking library was taken down because it's not clear who "owns" the code. This is a placeholder that I may check in at a later time.

It previously c++ code for many different types of target-tracking / estimation problems. Note, it was simply implementations of available research, nothing that was not already published by myself or other researchers.
